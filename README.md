[Our rationale for our A4 submission](https://github.com/6859-sp21/a4-hiphoptalks "A4 Rationale") which our final project was built on top of.

**A breakdown of how we split up the work.**

Similar to our work breakdown for A4, we split the work such that Yodahe focused on the website while Josh focused on the datasets.

**Joshua** primarily handled the creation of our data sets. This included finding current online databases we could pull from, working with different web APIs to build our own unique dataset, parsing through any unnecessary data, and cleaning up the data for use with the website. Joshua also helped with the design of our visualization and it's main interactions, as well as doing final touches on the actual website.

**Yodahe** primarily handled the development of the website visualizaiton. This included working with d3.js, building out the main interaction systems, creating the visualizations, and connecting the datasets to the website. Yodahe also helped with the design of our datasets and doing research of current online databses, as well as doing some touch ups to the datasets for the purposses of connecting them to the website.

**Comments on the Development Process**
This version of Hip Hop Talks, which was built on our initial two weeks of work in A4, took a month of work to build. 

In the beginning, we started with ideation and how we wanted to expand upon the ideas set out in A4. In A4, we had tackled the very simple question of "What words do Hip Hop artists say most?". In our final version, we decided to expand on that question by providing more artist-specific insight into our datasets. We also wanted to build on the playful experience of our original design (which came from typing out words) by including a "next word suggestion" feature. This feature would tell users the most likely next word to be said by an artist based on the word the user had typed. We had originally wanted to include this feature by syncing with the Spotify API and giving users a word suggestion based on their favorite artists; however, we quickly realized that the processing of this data would make it nigh impossible to have a fluid visualization/interaction, so we opted for simply using the artists already in our dataset.
